%Messing with the crash handler
%Most of the text stuff is at 80097E24
%A lot of strings are null terminated (00 is used between strings)

%so if you change the strings and trigger a crash, you get custom messages
%but make sure you don't break the crash handler if you do this stuff
%not exactly sure what happens if the crash handler causes an exception?
%	does it call the crash handler again?




%Copy the crash screen extra message from black pit
%This will make it more obvious what version the crash came from
