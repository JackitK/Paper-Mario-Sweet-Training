%Copied from Dark Star...basically only changes I'm making is removing functions that don't tie to my mod and reducing damage
%for certain effects like attacking a spike foe and poison (at least as long as it doesn't break sleep.)
% 3 damage is way too much passive damage for a mod you start at level one and likely will only get around 1-3 level ups
% Plus I was never the biggest fan of that feature anyways.... -JackitK

%Decided to make this two damage. Was gonna make it back to 1 damage but since the player can use moves to poison a foe,
%I want to give reason for the status to be valuable and Mario is going to start with more HP so this shouldn't be too annoying early game.
